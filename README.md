# A  SINGLE PAGE PHOTOGRAPHY WEBSITE
Hello everyone my name is 'David'. I am a junior fronted develper still in training.
I am currently working on a project to create a single page photography website. Below is a simple example
of how I have structured my code so far.

I built this single photography just to inspire me on what i should be working on my first project for building. I got
 the design from Ghanian software develper name "*EGATOR*".
